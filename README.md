# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

In this project, we performed an in-depth analysis of pizza sales using pizza data consisting of 4 different tables. The analysis was conducted using MySQL Workbench, and it focused on understanding customer orders, sales trends, and pizza preferences. We have used different queries, JOINS, Aggregate functions to find different insights on the data.
